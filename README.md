# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Retail  
This project is my first full stack App. It uses Java, Springboot, Hibernate, MySQL, and React.

## Description
This project uses a Java, Springboot, Hibernate backend with a React frontend to make an inventory app similar to what a retail store would want for inventory for their employees to use. It displays the product id, a picture of the product, it's name, description, and stock information such as current stock, preferred stock, and amount ordered. It allows for editing, and deleting items for when an item would be no longer sold or stock needs updated.
